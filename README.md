# todo-js
It was a trainee project to increase my poor experience in JavaScript

It has folowing functionality:
1. CRUD operations on todos
2. Setting finished\in-progress status for a todo or all of them
3. Removal all selected todos
4. Custom solution for pagination 
5. Tabs to see all todos with equal statuses (in-progress\finished\all)

Although it looks sometimes good thanks too Bootstrap CSS, the structure of the project may cause sickness
because of strange ideas of BEM-methodology usage in nesting directories for blocks :worried: :no_good: :monkey:
At that time I didn't know much unfortunally and got a red pillow later :wink:
